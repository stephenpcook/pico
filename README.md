# Raspberry Pi Pico Micropython experiments

This code is written to run on a raspberry pi pico with micropython.

Code in seven-segment.py is original, intended for driving a multiplexed
four-digit seven-segment LED display.

Code in experiments 1 through 7 is mostly taken directly from the kitronik
discovery kit for raspberry pi pico.  Experiment 7 has been more heavily
modified to have the piezo buzzer play a song.
